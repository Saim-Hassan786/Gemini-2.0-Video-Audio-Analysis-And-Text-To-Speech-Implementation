# üìä Gemini‚Äë2.0 Video-Audio Analysis and Text-to-Speech Implementation

This project explores the **theory and real-world usage** of Google‚Äôs **Gemini 2.0 multimodal model**. It integrates **video frame analysis**, **audio stream understanding**, and **text-to-speech (TTS) generation** into a unified system. This implementation serves as both a **learning tool** and a **prototype** for advanced AI applications in multimedia.

---

## üéØ Objective

To demonstrate how a **single AI model** (Gemini 2.0) can:
- Analyze videos through extracted frames.
- Understand spoken content in audio.
- Answer questions about visual/audio input.
- Convert textual insights into realistic spoken audio.

This project links modern **multimodal AI theory** with **hands-on implementation**.

## üß† Theoretical Foundation

### 1. Multimodal AI

**Multimodal models** process **multiple types of data** at once (e.g., images + sound + text).  
Gemini 2.0 is trained to:
- Treat everything (text, video frames, audio) as a **sequence of tokens**.
- Perform **joint reasoning** across all modalities.
- Return **text or audio outputs** depending on the request.

### 2. Video Analysis

- Videos are **sampled into frames** at a given rate (e.g., 1 FPS).
- Each frame is tokenized and added to the model's input context.
- This allows Gemini to describe, summarize, or explain the video content.
- Frame timestamps can be retained for **temporal understanding**.

### 3. Audio Analysis

- Audio is represented as **tokens** (about 32 tokens/sec).
- Gemini can perform **speech recognition**, **emotion analysis**, and **sound classification**.
- Audio inputs can be used **alone or alongside video** for better understanding.

### 4. Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Gemini 2.0 Flash supports:
- Converting text into **spoken voice audio**.
- Controlling **speaker voice**, **tone**, **speed**, and **emotion** using prompts.
- Generating output as **streamed audio** (e.g., WAV, MP3).

## üß™ Notebook Overview

The Jupyter notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Load media files** (video/audio).
2. **Extract visual and audio data** using preprocessing tools.
3. **Create a multimodal prompt** for Gemini including frame snapshots and/or audio.
4. **Call Gemini API** to perform analysis, captioning, or Q&A.
5. **Use TTS output modality** to convert the result into human-like speech.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Google Gemini API (via `google.generativeai`)
- OpenCV and moviepy (for video/audio preprocessing)
- Wave library (to handle audio output)

## üìö Learning Goals

This project helps you understand:
- How Google‚Äôs Gemini model handles different types of input.
- How to structure prompts for complex, cross-modal tasks.
- How to generate audio responses using generative speech synthesis.
- How theory (like token-based representation) translates into practice.
